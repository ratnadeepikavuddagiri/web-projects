<p style="font-size:20px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:15px;color:white;filter:gray;">The blood bank is a web page the main intention to create this web page to help the people who need blood. Every day 12,000 people in India die due to the sheer lack of donated blood and many more across the world. India collects 11 million units of blood but needs 15 million units, so there’s a deficit of 4 million units. Over 40 districts in India don’t have a single blood bank. Blood donations in India are conducted by several organizations and hospitals by organizing blood donation camps. Donors can visit blood banks in hospitals to donate blood or directly to a receiver. despite the shortage of donated blood, efforts by the government and various organizations have led to a decrease in the demand and supply gap over the years. the number of voluntary blood donors increases from 54.4% in 2006-2007 to 83.1% in 2012-2013,with the number of blood units increasing from 4.4 million units in 2006-2007 to 9.3 million units in 2012- 2013,The current scenario is definitely better. In 2016 the Ministry of health and family welfare reported a donation of 10.9 million units against a requirement of 12 million units.</p><br>
